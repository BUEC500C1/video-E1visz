## Project Mission
Develop a queue system that can collect the latest twitters of a given hashtage and convert the text to a short video summary in the same time.
## Architecture Needed

* Python code running on computer.    

* twitter API(Tweepy).  

* Pillow(PIL).  

* OpenCV(cv2).  

* Queue, Threading.  

## Run Program
*Assumes __OpenCV, Pillow__ package already installed.*

*Assumes __twitter API Keys__ available.*

*Requires __Python 3.x__ to run!*

1. Clone the repo by using the command below.
 ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/BUEC500C1/video-E1visz.git
  ```

2. Ensure the following Python packages are installed: cv2, PIL, tweepy
  ```
  $ pip install opencv  
  $ pip install pillow
  $ pip install tweepy
  ```
3. Add API key to local "configr.py" file and save:  
  ```
  consumer_key = "your API key"
  consumer_secret = "your API secret key"
  access_token = "your access token key"
  access_token_secret = "your access token secret key"
  ```
